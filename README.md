# Robot-Wall-Following-and-PID
Completed with partner Aidan Anderson for the USF Course Control of Mobile Robotics. Contains python scripts used to make the provided Raspberry Pi Robot perform three tasks involving wall detection and PID. task1.py has the robot move forward and stop once it detects an obstacle in front of it that is 12 inches or less away. wallDistance.py has the robot move, using PID to adjust its speed until it senses an obstacle in front of it and reorienting itself if it gets too close to obstacles to its sides. wallFollowing.py has the robot move, using PID to adjust its speed until it is 12 inches away from a front obstacle and adjusting its orientation if too close to side obstacles. wallFollowing.py also has the robot rotate 90 (clockwise or counterclockwise) or 180 degrees depending on if obstacles are detected to its left or right.
